			<p> Welcome!<BR><BR>
			Unity Exchange is a community of digital artists, writers, artists, story teller geeks, and muses. We are behooved to promote social impact by use of technology as a tool. <BR><BR>

			There are stories to be told to preserve timeless lessons. Technology rapidly iterates new experiences which we are excited to share. We remember practices and rhythms prehistoric to the interwebz. <BR><BR>
			We invite you to support and help cultivate a culture that acknowledges legacy, while connecting modern influences of present time. It's more fun together.<BR><BR>
			Connect with us at: admin [at] unity [dot] exchange.</p>
